# Using Reflectition With Private Setter
This project want to show how to use NewtonsoftJson to deserialize values to objects that have private setters.

It is a simple .Net console application and all the code is in Program.cs file.
My intention is not to express how a code design is written, but express how to configure the project to fill properties that have private setters.

Sorry if my english is not very well, I'm practicing it right now üòÅ
